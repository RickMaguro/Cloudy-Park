# Dungeon Cauldron

The game consists of an initial interface (New game, Quite), and an animation that introduces the story. Operation is as simple as clicking and dragging the materials on the screen into the slots on either side of the cauldron. Since the player is trapped by the demon, the goal is to keep mixing materials and obtaining new materials until the final potion is obtained. Once the demon gets the potion, it will be happy to release the player, otherwise the demon will eat the player if it cannot make the potion within three minutes.
